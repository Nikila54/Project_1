SecureCheck is an interactive, Streamlit-powered dashboard for managing and analyzing traffic stop data in real time. Built with Python, pandas, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2, PostgreSQL, and Plotly, it allows you to upload a CSV of traffic stop records and seamlessly push it into a PostgreSQL database. The dashboard displays all records in a searchable table, alongside key metrics such as total stops, total arrests, unique drivers, and drug-related incidents. Rich visualizations—including a bar chart for stop violations and pie charts for driver gender, race breakdown, and stop outcomes—help uncover patterns at a glance. Users can choose from a library of medium- and complex-level SQL queries to explore topics like top vehicles in drug-related stops, arrest rates by age group, and country-level trends using window functions. A form enables hypothetical input of new stops and displays placeholder predictions for the likely violation and outcome. Overall, SecureCheck offers a complete pipeline—from data ingest to database integration, visualization, analytics, and interactive querying—that’s ready to be expanded, customized, and even deployed for real-world traffic-data applications.
